    # Remember me. A memory game.

Remember me is a card based memory game that the player needs to flip and match the cards to complete it.


 
## UX
The player needs to match two cards by fliping them over and opening the same shape card twice in a row. 
Once this is achieved the cards remain open, The goal is to match all cards as quickly as possible and make sure to do it with as little moves as possible. Upon completion, player receives a star rating for their game and also the time and moves utilized.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in this project are HTML for the content of the game including the icons for the game cards from Font Awesome, CSS to style the content and lastly Javascript manipulate the DOM and make it interactive.

## Testing

The code has been tested through HTML, CSS and JS validators producing possitive results. 
Responsiveness has been tested through google chrome inspect and various devices such as Macmini, iphone xs, pixel2 ipad pro and although on google chrome iphone 5 did appear to distort the game into two columns, the device did not. 



## Deployment

Initially written in aws cloud9 and since this platform is undergoing a transition and was problematic running the project, the final touches have been written in atom utilizing live server package and later deployed on github pages.
