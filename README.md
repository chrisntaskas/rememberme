    # Remember me. A memory game.

Remember me is a card based memory game that the player needs to flip and match the cards to complete it.


 
## UX
Remember me is a card based memory game that the player needs to flip and match the cards to complete it.
Once this is achieved the cards remain open, The goal is to match all cards as quickly as possible and make sure to do it with as little moves as possible. Upon completion, player receives a star rating for their game and also the time and moves utilized.
